# Dockerfile Best Practices and Potential Issues
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: using an outdated base image, not specifying Python versions, and failing to clean up temporary files.

The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, which can change unexpectedly. It also installs Python without version specification and doesn't clean up apt packages.  This results in a larger image and potential compatibility problems.

The improved `Dockerfile.fixed` addresses these issues by:

1. Specifying a version for the base image (`ubuntu:22.04`).
2. Specifying Python versions (`python3.9` in this example).
3. Using `apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove` to remove unnecessary packages.
4. Utilizing a multi-stage build to reduce the final image size.

This example highlights the importance of using specific versions and cleaning up temporary files to maintain consistency and reduce image size.
